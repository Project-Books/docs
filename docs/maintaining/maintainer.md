# Becoming a maintainer template

If the project owner has offered you the position of becoming a maintainer, we will ask you the 
following questions. These questions help us both set the expectations.

As explained in the [core team document](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/blob/master/docs/maintainers/CORE_TEAM.md), 
we appreciate that becoming a maintainer is a big commitment (and we are very appreciative of our 
maintainers). We want to be flexible to respect your other commitments. If your availability 
changes, that's fine. The important thing is to let us know so that we can continue to be respectful
of your time.

1. At the very minimum, how frequently are you able to contribute 
(e.g. once a week, once a fortnight, etc.)?

2. What is the main area that you will be able to help with (e.g. Spring, React, Docker, 
documentation, design etc.)?

3. At the minimum, how often can you help with reviewing pull requests (we aim to review all 
pull requests within at most seven days)?

4. Are you able to help fix failing builds or when we have high-priority bugs to fix regularly? 
If so, how often (e.g. weekly, fortnightly)?

5. Are you able to help others and respond to others on our Slack workspace 
(we aim to respond to messages within at most seven days)?
