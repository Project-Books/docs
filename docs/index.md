Welcome to the documentation site for [Project Books](https://github.com/Project-Books)!
This site brings together documents that apply to all of our projects (see below) in one place.

## Book Project

![logo](images/logo-one-line@5x.png)

The [Book Project](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project) is currently a book tracker. This
allows readers to track books they would like to read, are currently reading, have read or did not
finish. We're looking to expand the Book Project to become a book platform for readers where they 
can interact with other readers to find the next good book to read.

We're using Java with Spring Boot, React with TypeScript, PostgreSQL and other technologies to build this.

We started the Book Project out of a desire for a substantially better Goodreads, but we're also
looking to redefine the experience at every step. For more information, see our 
[vision](https://project-books.github.io/vision/) for the Book Project
and our [FAQs](https://project-books.github.io/about/faq/).

## Books API

The [Books API](https://github.com/Project-Books/books-api) is a GraphQL API that stores books,
authors, publishers and more.

It is written in Java using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and the 
[DGS](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/) framework.

The [Books API](https://github.com/Project-Books/books-api) is a sibling and supporting project to 
the [Book Project](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project). However, we have also designed it
to be standalone. Curating and maintaining a large and high-quality selection of books is hard.
We hope that by providing a good, easy-to-use API, others who also consume our API may want to 
contribute back by adding books to our collection.
