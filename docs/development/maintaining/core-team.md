# Core Team

Everyone who commits to the Book Project is considered a part of our team. The core team refers to those who beyond committing to the project and have added responsibilities to help maintain and push the project forward. 

All those in the core are held to the highest standard of our [code of conduct](https://project-books.github.io/docs/code-of-conduct/).
In particular, all maintainers must be welcoming and inclusive to all at all times. If they are not, their role as a maintainer could be revoked. 

## Project owner

Karan ([@knjk04](https://github.com/knjk04)) first started this project and is the owner of the repository. As the project owner, this role also includes the maintainer role. Karan is active in committing to the project, reviewing code and helping others on the project over
Slack.

Karan has the final say on decisions and is in responsible for the overall direction of the project. However, Karan is always open to new ideas and thoughts. If you think
something could be done better, speak up! While we cannot guarantee that we will take your suggestion forward, we can promise that your feedback is valuable and that you
will be responded to, regardless of whether we take up your suggestion. If we don't take your suggestion forward, we'll also let you know why.

Should you have any concerns about any of the maintainers, Karan is the person to speak to. You can message him privately on Slack.
