## Prerequisites

After you have had at least two pull requests merged in (so that you understand our working process), 
you can help us triage issues and pull requests.

You will also need to join our Slack workspace.

## What it involves

- Helping to add labels to issues by following our labelling conventions
- Checking up on people who have been assigned seven days ago to an issue but have not provided an 
update (which may be on Slack) or created a pull request
- Sending short thank you messages when someone creates a pull request and informing them that we will review it shortly
- Informing new contributors that we can assign them to one issue at a time

This list may change over time. If it does, we'll check in with you to ensure you are still happy to be a triager.

As a triager, you are representing our project. Consequently, we hold you to high standards and 
expect you to adhere to our code of conduct at all times (be kind and welcoming). You will also 
need to stay up-to-date with our code of conduct and contributing guidelines.

## How to become a triager

Message 'Karan Kumar' (@[knjk04](https://github.com/knjk04)) on Slack (publicly or privately) and 
confirm that you have read and agree to this document.

## Removing a triager

In the following (non-exhaustive) exceptional circumstances, we may remove you as a triager:

- Violating the code of conduct or contributing guidelines
- Abusing the role
- Lack of participation for more than two months
